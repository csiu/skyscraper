## Tidying the data
```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
raw_file <- "tallest100buildings.csv"

raw <- read_csv(raw_file)

colnames(raw) <- c("rank", "building_name", "city", 
                   "height_m", "height_ft", "floors", 
                   "year_completed", "material", "use")

(raw <- raw %>% 
  mutate(city = as.factor(city),
         #year_completed = as.factor(year_completed),
         material = as.factor(material)))
```
