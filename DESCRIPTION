Description: Who doesn't want to randomly know where the tallest building in the world is?
    Scraped from The Skyscraper Center, I present to you the list of
    100 Tallest Completed Buildings in the World ... along with information about
    which city the building resides in, how high is it, how many floors does it have,
    when was it completed, what material is it made of, and for what purpose does it serve.
Depends:
    R (>= 2.10)
